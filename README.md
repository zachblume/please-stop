# please-stop
Stop all gmail spam once and for all, without any clicks. Simply do not "read" 4 emails in one week from the same sender, and it sends future emails from that sender to archive. After a couple weeks... no more spam! Auto-whitelists certain keywords like "interview", and obeys your existing whitlists.
